# Build log — round 2, the honest record round

Append-only. One entry per event, newest at the bottom.
Format: `## [date time] <task id> | <what happened>`

Round 1's log is `factory/log.md` and is **read-only**.

## [2026-07-27 handoff] — | Round 2 compiled and handed off

Branch `factory/honest-record` created off `main` at `a256bdf`.

Sources: `factory/BRIEF-2.md` (six findings from a conceptual-model stress test
run against `Code.gs` and `Index.html` directly), `factory/PLAN-2.md` (16 tasks,
four stages, 31-assertion contract, 112 acceptance criteria).

Baseline measured green before any work: 492 assertions / 0 failed, lint all
clear across 17 rules and 38 files, headless ok at 19 checks per viewport
including round 1's drawer and tap-count phases.

One repo change made during pre-flight, before the loop starts: `test/lint.js`
gained a ninth entry in `SCOPE_QUOTE_EXEMPT` for `factory/ROUND-1.md`. That file
is round 1's archived record and quotes "one OAuth scope" twice — once from
review 2's finding 3, once from amendment A2's own wording. The text was already
exempt while it lived in `factory/STATE.md`; archiving it into its own file moved
the exemption with it rather than creating a new one. The rule was verified still
live by appending a false scope claim to `factory/BRIEF-2.md`, watching lint fail
by name, and removing it.

Loop has not started.
